# Amazon Webscraper

This is just a web scraper that I made, when I was younger, to find products to sell on amazon.. to use this project, you must add all the links to the 
"amazon.txt" file seperated with ";"s and run the program.

This will print the name of the product, price and its bsr. I made this with Selenium and Python.
